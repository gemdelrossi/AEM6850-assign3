# This is my read me file

The purpose of this R script and assignment was to demonstrate how many clustered errors we need in general to be considered reliable and a good estimate of the underlying sample distribution.

To do this, I ran multiple Monte Carlo simulations with a double for-loop to capture the impacts of different numbers of observations per sample and number of clusters has on the accuracy of regression estimates. 

To correctly run this assignment, please open the R Project file AEM6850-assign3.Rproj and then the R script file.

The final output will be found within the assignment-3 folder labeled as "clusters.png". 

I hope everything goes smoothly and you get the desired output!
